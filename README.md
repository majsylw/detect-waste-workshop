# Detect-Waste with AI course

Welcome to the “International Workshop on Promoting AI-Supported Eco-Activism in the Western Balkans”. 
This workshop aims to bring together researchers, activists, policymakers, and practitioners from the region to explore innovative ways of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance environmental activism.

**Date:** September 26th and 27th, 2024

**Location:** Prilep, North Macedonia

**Eligibility:** Participants from North Macedonia, Kosovo*, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are invited to apply.

**Speakers:**  Pavel Gora Ph.D.; Sylwia Majchrowska Ph.D.; Marjan Angeleski Ph.D; Gjorgji Mancheski Ph.D; Dimitar Nikoloski Ph.D. 

## Introduction
In recent years, the Western Balkans region has faced numerous environmental challenges, ranging from air and water pollution to biodiversity loss and climate change impacts. This workshop provides a platform to discuss how AI technologies can be leveraged to address these pressing issues and empower eco-activists in the region.

Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:
- AI applications for environmental monitoring and conservation
- Data-driven approaches to assess environmental impacts
- Appling Computer vision and neural networks in environment protection   
- Use of drones in detection environmental problems
- AI-supported activism strategies for climate change mitigation
- Ethics and challenges of using AI in eco-activism
- AI supported crowdsourcing in the eco-activism  
- Collaborative efforts between academia, civil society, and government in utilizing AI for environmental protection

## Course Structure
The whorkshop is structured to run over 2 days, offering a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application:
- Lectures: Each day will begin with lectures covering key topics in waste management using AI, including understanding the TACO dataset, machine learning models for waste classification, and the importance of accurate waste sorting.
- Hands-on Sessions: Following the lectures, participants will engage in hands-on sessions where trainers will guide them through Jupyter notebooks, demonstrating the application of AI techniques in waste management.

## About Hands-on Sessions
The interactive sesions on waste management with AI are part of a comprehensive program designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage artificial intelligence in tackling waste management challenges. The series is structured into two main parts, each focusing on different aspects of waste management and AI applications. The workshop is better suited to individuals who use python and have some experience working within data science and already possess some understanding of python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and PyTorch.

### Part 1: Introduction to exploring Trash Annotations in COntext (TACO)
This part provides an overview of waste types using public dataset, covering data cleaning, preparation, and labeling standards. Participants will also conduct exploratory data analysis to understand data and label quality and their impact on machine learning training.

### Part 2: AI applications in waste classification and detection
This part gives an overview of AI applications in waste detection and introduces a pipeline for waste classification and detection based on the TACO dataset. It explores strategies for improving model accuracy, such as data augmentation and various learning approaches, and showcases successful waste management projects in diverse settings.

## Feedback
We welcome questions, suggestions, and ideas from participants. Your input is invaluable to us!


## Obtaining Course Materials
Course materials, including Jupyter notebooks for the hands-on sessions, will be available in this GitHub repository. Additional instructions are provided under this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ly5htvdlFmHtKCaZtZrzu5uG_JtrplyQkhpVfULoeM/edit?usp=drive_link). Participants are encouraged to follow along with the example code, attempt exercises to practice the concepts learned, and download the latest version of the materials before each lecture to stay updated.

***Important:*** The course materials will be updated throughout the course, ensuring you have access to the most current information and examples.
